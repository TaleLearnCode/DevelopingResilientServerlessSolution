![Developing a Resilient Serverless Solution](Thumbnail.jpg)

## Abstract
So, you have decided to develop a serverless solution using Azure Functions because it makes it easy to get things up and running and handles all the scalability issues for you. All you have to do is write the code. However, while Azure Functions (and other similar serverless services) offer a great set of features that make scalability, resilience, and reliability easier, it is not fool-proof and can still go down. During this session, we will talk about how to make your Azure Function solutions more resilient, how to validate it will continue to work under load, and how to know about potential failures or at least the failures before your customer does.

## Short Abstract
Just because serverless means you do not have to worry about the server less, there is still work needed to ensure resiliency.
